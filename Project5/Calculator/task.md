### PAUSE 1 
TODO: Write out the other 3 functions - subtract, multiply and divide.

### PAUSE 2
TODO: Add these 4 functions into a dictionary as the values. Keys = "`+`", "`-`", "`*`", "`/`"

### PAUSE 3
TODO: Use the dictionary operations to perform the calculations. Multiply 4 * 8 using the dictionary.


### Functionality
- Program asks the user to type the first number.
- Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "`+`", "`-`", "`*`" or "`/`")
- Program asks the user to type the second number.
- Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
- Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
- If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
- If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.

  Try writing out a flowchart to plan your program.

<div class="hint">
    To call multiplication from the operations dictionary, you would write your code like this:

<code>result = operations["*"](n1= 5, n2= 3)</code>

result would then be equal to 15.
